# Checkpoint 04012026_2135

- Fixed CLOB websocket handling (subscribe chunking, reconnect loop, price_change support, buys/sells normalization).
- Added tracked markets, alert rules/ack, data quality checks, and wallet position refresh flow.
- Expanded web UI with filters, arb panel, signal detail, alert rules editor, and quality/issues views.
- Updated config/spec docs to reflect new keys and storage.

Notes:
- Consider adding tag taxonomy ingestion (tags/related-tags) to make include/exclude filters richer.
- If DB migrations become necessary, introduce Alembic before schema drift gets worse.
- Evaluate whether wallet positions should be netted by outcome or stored per-token for accuracy.
