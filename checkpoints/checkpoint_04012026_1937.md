# checkpoint_04012026_1937

## What changed

- Added implementation-ready specs under `specs/` for a Python-first Polymarket research dashboard:
  - architecture, data sources, storage schema, ingestion jobs
  - wallet/large-trade signals, size-aware arb signals, markets explorer
  - alerts, UI/UX, ops/testing, configuration model

## Key decisions captured in the spec

- Canonical wallet = Data API `proxyWallet` (fallbacks only if missing).
- Large-trade detection uses Data API `/trades` with `takerOnly=true` and USD-based filtering.
- Arb detection is depth-aware (orderbook asks) and emits size + edge evidence; midpoints are not used for arb decisions.
- Market filtering/ranking combines Gamma volume/liquidity with Data API open interest and (optionally) CLOB microstructure.

## Open questions to resolve later

- Hosting model (local vs hosted) and whether we need user auth for the UI.
- Which alert channels you want first (Slack vs Telegram vs email).
- Whether “new wallet” should also include “dormant wallet reactivated” as a first-class view.
