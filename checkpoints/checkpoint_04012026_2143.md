# Checkpoint 04012026_2143

- Generated `requirements.txt` from `pyproject.toml` using uv.
- Added `.uv-cache/` to `.gitignore` to keep uv resolver cache out of git.
- Created uv virtualenv and synced dev dependencies to run tests cleanly.

Notes:
- Consider adding `requirements-dev.txt` if you want a pinned dev/test bundle separate from prod.
