# Checkpoint 04012026_2311

- Added a per-run wallet cache in trade ingestion to avoid duplicate wallet inserts in the same session.
- Hardened job runner to rollback after exceptions before updating job_run metadata.
- Normalized datetime comparisons for arb engine and wallet signals to avoid naive/aware errors.
- Tests run: `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run pytest`.

Notes:
- If wallet duplication persists across concurrent app instances, consider an upsert-based wallet write path.
