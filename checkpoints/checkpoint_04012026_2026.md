# Checkpoint

- Improved fixture fetcher to select a Gamma market that actually has a live CLOB orderbook.
- Added flags to control websocket strictness and trade fallback behavior; documented in fixtures README.
- Refreshed fixtures; manifest now records empty market-filtered trades and WS snapshot fetch failure.

Notes:
- WS snapshot continues to be flaky; script now records failures instead of hard failing by default.
- Market-filtered trades can be empty; fallback is opt-in for shape sampling.
