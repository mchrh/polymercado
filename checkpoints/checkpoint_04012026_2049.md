# Checkpoint

- Implemented full Python stack: FastAPI web UI, APScheduler jobs, SQLAlchemy models, ingestion pipelines, signal engine, and alert dispatcher.
- Added fixtures fetcher, tests (unit + integration), and minimal package layout with uv/ruff/pytest.
- Updated specs to align with implementation (config keys, alert_log severity, storage tables).

Notes:
- WebSocket book fetch is best-effort and can be flaky; polling remains the default unless CLOB_WS_ENABLED is set.
- Trades filtering by market can be empty; fixtures can be refreshed with fallback flag if needed.
