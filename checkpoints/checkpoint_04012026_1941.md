# Checkpoint

- Read `AGENTS.md` and all specs in `specs/`.
- Key architecture: Python-first (FastAPI + Jinja2/HTMX), APScheduler, Postgres, async httpx + websockets; signals emitted to `signal_events`.
- Ingestion: Gamma events/markets, Data API trades + OI, CLOB books/websocket; idempotent dedupe; tracked-universe cap.
- Signals: large taker trades + new wallets; depth-aware binary arb (buy YES+NO) with `q_max` and edge thresholds; cooldown/dedupe.
- Config/ops: env > DB > defaults; alert routing + dedupe; structured logs + health endpoints; unit/integration tests with fixtures.
- UI: Markets, Arb screener, Whale tape, Wallets, Alerts, Config; explainability/evidence emphasis.

Notes:
- Need to align field names and edge cases with `api_docs/` before implementation.
- Open questions to confirm: hosting/auth, alert channels, “new wallet” semantics vs dormancy.
