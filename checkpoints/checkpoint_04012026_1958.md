# Checkpoint

- Updated specs to align with API docs: /public-search, POST /books, GET /midpoint, Data API eventId casting, OI response mapping.
- Gamma normalization: outcomes/outcomePrices JSON strings; clobTokenIds array or JSON string; prefer volumeNum/liquidityNum.
- Wallet identity: proxyWallet only; missing proxyWallet means skip wallet-based signals.
- Neg risk normalization: prefer CLOB neg_risk when books exist; fallback to Gamma negRisk.
- Added WS vs REST timestamp normalization notes for orderbooks.

Notes:
- Quickstart examples show clobTokenIds arrays while OpenAPI types it as string; parser should accept both.
