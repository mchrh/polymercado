# Checkpoint

- Reviewed api_docs for Gamma, Data API, and CLOB REST/WebSocket; mapped field names and key params to specs.
- Noted mismatches: Gamma uses string fields for outcomes/clobTokenIds/volume/liquidity, Data API lacks user/owner in trade payloads, /public-search endpoint name, event ID type inconsistencies, and WebSocket book schema vs docs.
- Added `pyproject.toml` for uv-based Python project; created `.venv` via `uv venv`.

Questions/risks:
- Need to confirm how Gamma serializes `clobTokenIds`, `outcomes`, and `outcomePrices` (JSON string vs comma-separated).
- Decide which source of `negRisk` is authoritative (Gamma event vs CLOB book vs Data API positions).
- Verify whether GET `/prices` requires query params or returns all tokens; docs omit params.
