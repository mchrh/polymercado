# Checkpoint 04012026_2252

- Limited `sync_large_trades` to a lookback window on cold start and capped pages per run to keep the scheduler responsive.
- Added per-page commits/expire to release sqlite write locks sooner during trade ingestion.
- Documented `TRADES_MAX_PAGES` and `TRADES_INITIAL_LOOKBACK_HOURS` in specs.
- Tests run: `uv run ruff format .`, `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run pytest`.

Notes:
- If arb/other CLOB views still stall, consider batching websocket book writes or reducing tracked universe to lower write contention.
