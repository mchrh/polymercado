# Checkpoint

- Mapped API docs to specs and updated specs to match actual endpoints/fields.
- Gamma: parse outcomes/outcomePrices JSON strings; handle clobTokenIds array or JSON string; prefer volumeNum/liquidityNum.
- Data API: proxyWallet is the only documented wallet identity; eventId expects integers; /oi returns {market, value}.
- CLOB: /books is POST, /midpoint is the midpoint endpoint; WS book uses bids/asks and ms timestamps.
- Normalized neg risk naming across APIs to neg_risk.
- Added minimal Python project config: pyproject.toml, created .venv with uv.

Notes:
- Quickstart shows clobTokenIds as arrays while OpenAPI types it as string; parser should accept both.
- Event IDs are strings in Gamma but int in Data API params; keep a casting helper.
