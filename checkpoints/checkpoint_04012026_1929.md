## Dashboard ideas: research platform scope

### Core signals requested

1) New wallets making sizeable trades
   - Use Data API `/trades` with `filterType=CASH` + `filterAmount` to catch large taker prints.
   - Track `proxyWallet` as the primary actor (most users trade via proxy wallets).
   - Maintain `wallet_first_seen` and per-wallet aggregates (gross volume, net exposure by market/tag, win-rate after resolution, etc).

2) Binary arb
   - Executable arb is based on *best asks* (cost to buy) and/or *best bids* (proceeds to sell), not midpoints.
   - Track:
     - Buy-side arb: `ask_yes + ask_no < 1 - margin`
     - Sell-side arb (if you can mint/split into both tokens): `bid_yes + bid_no > 1 + margin`
   - Add size-aware checks using orderbook depth (not just top of book).

3) Market filtering by category + liquidity
   - Category: Gamma `tag_id`, `related_tags`, `sports`, `series_id`, search.
   - Liquidity:
     - Gamma `liquidity`/`volume` fields (indexed).
     - Data API `/oi` for open interest by `market` (conditionId).

### Additional high-leverage modules

- Alerting/automation: saved screens + push alerts (email/Slack/Telegram) for thresholds (wallet size, arb margin, OI spikes).
- “Flow” analytics: net buy pressure by market/tag; taker vs maker; orderbook imbalance; time-to-fill proxies.
- Volatility/regime: price history + realized vol; abnormal moves vs category baseline; momentum/mean reversion indicators.
- Negative-risk sanity checks: constraints across outcomes/events (and “augmented” neg-risk guardrails).
- Resolution risk tracking: UMA status, clarification/bulletin-board deltas; highlight markets with high dispute probability.

## Architecture sketch (minimal)

- Ingestion: periodic polling (Data API trades/OI, Gamma markets/events) + optional CLOB market websocket for realtime book deltas.
- Storage: Postgres (markets/events/tags/tokens/trades/wallets + time-series snapshots for prices/OI).
- Compute: background workers to materialize “signals” tables (new whales, arbs, trending markets).
- UI: Next.js/React dashboard with saved filters + drilldowns.
