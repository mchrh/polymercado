# Checkpoint

- Added minimal Python package layout under `src/polymercado` to satisfy hatch build and uv sync.
- Added fixture fetch script and fixtures README; script pulls Gamma/Data/CLOB REST plus CLOB WS book, writes a manifest, and normalizes token selection.
- Captured live fixtures in `tests/fixtures/polymarket/` and generated `uv.lock` after `uv sync --extra dev`.

Notes:
- WebSocket endpoint behavior was inconsistent; script now tries multiple URLs and subscription payload variants (market/MARKET/subscribe).
- CLOB /book can 404 for Gamma token IDs; script falls back to trade token asset id.
